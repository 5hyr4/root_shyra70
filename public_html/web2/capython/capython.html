        <p>In this project, our team decided to make an ad campaign on our game called "A Sprout Game" by making a short trailer.</p>
        <p>Check it out! <a href="https://nicolas93.582mi.com/capython/index.html">CAPYTHON PROJECT</a> </p>

    
        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>My role was to create characters that would properly match the aesthetic of our game. Here is a list of what I needed:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>three game characters</li> 
            <li>full body illustration (X3)</li>
            <li>expression sheet (X3)</li>
            <li>walking poses (X3)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>SOLUTION</h2>

        <h3>HOW?</h3>
        <p>In order to come up with the characters, I took into consideration two factors:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The target audience</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Since our game is targeted towards younger people, mostly teenagers, I wanted to create characters that resemebled them. Additionally, I chose a cuter and cozier artstyle to match the indie aesthetic of the game.
        </p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Characteristics</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to figure out each of their physical appearances, I decied to base them off of a single word characteristic they might have. For example, the first character is defined as spontaneous, the second character is strong and the third character is smart. This is also a way to differentiate, and give each of them a unique vibe.

        <h3>COLOR CHOICES</h3>

        <section id="color-choices">
        <figure>
            <img src="images/full_body1.jpeg" alt="">
        </figure>
        <p>This character is our main character so I wanted to make him stand out with the colors I used, mainly the color GREEN since it ties in with the topic of the environment. In order to portray his spontaneous, bright and optimistic personality, I chose the color YELLOW for his hair and ORANGE for his scarf. 
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/full_body2.jpeg" alt="">
        </figure>
        <p>This character's main characteristic is his strength. Therefore, I thought it was appropriate to give him darker colors like BLACK and BROWN. Also, to show courage and power, I made his shiirt the color RED. </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/full_body3.jpeg" alt="">
        </figure>
        <p>This character's main characteristic is her intelligence so I decided to make her colors mainly BLUE. I added accent colors like YELLOW and RED to represent her optimism and perseverance to find solutions</p>
